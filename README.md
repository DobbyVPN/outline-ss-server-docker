# outline-ss-server-docker

Docker build for `outline-ss-server`.

The image defaults to `-config=/etc/secrets/config.yml`. This makes the image
self-configuring on hosts such as Render that mount a runtime secret file at
that path but do not reliably apply a separately configured Docker command to
prebuilt images. Supplying arguments to `docker run` replaces the default
`CMD` while preserving the `/outline-ss-server` entrypoint.
